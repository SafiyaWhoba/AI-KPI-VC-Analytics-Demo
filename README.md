## Purpose
This repository demonstrates how **genetic algorithms (GA)** and **fuzzy logic** can be applied to venture capital (VC) decision-making.  
The aim is to improve **prediction of startup performance** and **monitoring of portfolio health**.



## Background
The venture capital ecosystem faces persistent challenges:

- ~90% early-stage startup failure rate  
- Asymmetric information between investors and founders  
- Inefficient monitoring of capital deployment  

This demonstration illustrates a methodology designed to address these issues.



## Demo Features
- Synthetic dataset of startup KPIs (financial, operational, growth)  
- Basic GA optimization loop  
- Example fuzzy-rule for interpretability:  
  > *IF revenue growth is HIGH and burn rate is LOW THEN success likelihood is HIGH*  
- Visualization of prediction results and calibration  


## Example Output
- ROC curve & AUC comparison (baseline vs. GA+Fuzzy)  
- Early-warning alert chart for KPI deviation  
- Lift chart showing improved identification of successful startups
