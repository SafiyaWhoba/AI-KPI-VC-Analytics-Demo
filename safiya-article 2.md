# GitHub Demonstration README

## Repository Title
**Al-KPI-VC-Analytics-Demo**


## Purpose
This repository demonstrates how **genetic algorithms (GA)** and **fuzzy logic** can be applied to venture capital decision-making, improving prediction of startup performance and monitoring portfolio health.


## Background
The venture capital ecosystem faces challenges such as:
- ~90% early-stage startup failure rates  
- Asymmetric information between investors and founders  
- Inefficient monitoring of capital deployment  

This demonstration illustrates a methodology to address these challenges.


## Demo Features
- Synthetic dataset of startup KPIs (financial, operational, growth)  
- Basic GA optimization loop  
- Example fuzzy-rule for interpretability:  
  > *IF revenue growth is HIGH and burn rate is LOW THEN success likelihood is HIGH*  
- Visualization of prediction results and calibration  


## Example Output
- ROC curve & AUC comparison (baseline vs. GA+Fuzzy)  
- Early-warning alert chart for KPI deviation  
- Lift chart showing improved identification of successful startups
